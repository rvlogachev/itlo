<p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling <a href="#" target="_blank">WordPress</a> underwear in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey. It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says.

She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>There was that beautiful <i>Italian Vogue</i> story and the girls that were in that ended up doing really well the classic lace-up shoe is a true.</p>
<p>I feel like for a minute, it was starting to feel like this plus size I&#8217;m not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls really was a trend.</p>
<p>That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.</p>

<p>Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.</p>

It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>
