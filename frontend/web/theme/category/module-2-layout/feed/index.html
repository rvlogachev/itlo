<p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling <a href="#" target="_blank">WordPress</a> underwear in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey. It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> underwear in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey. It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> underwear in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey. It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>The model is talking about booking her latest gig, modeling <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> underwear in the brand latest Perfectly Fit campaign, which was shot by Lachian Bailey. It was such a surreal moment cried she admitted.</p>
<h3><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey is just be nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of confusing because I&#8217;m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I&#8217;m not the biggest girl on the market but I&#8217;m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn&#8217;t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.</p>
<p>Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.</p>
